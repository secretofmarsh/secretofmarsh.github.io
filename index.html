<h1 id="blurbheader">THE REAL REASON THEY WON'T LET YOU STAND ON THE SEAL</h1>
	<p id="mainblurb">The seal located at Marsh Plaza on Boston University campus is an ostensible memorial to the school's values and history. However,
	a darker, more sinister secret might be "sealed" away by this inconspicious monument that thousands of students pass by everyday. Recent
	findings point towards something greater being at play here, which you can read below.
	Who's to tell you where you CAN and CANNOT stand and or walk??? Start asking questions, we'll start finding answers.</p>

		<h3>SEISMOGRAPH READING! THE SEAL IS VIBRATING!?</h3>
		<p id="seistesty"> Students from the Seismology Society provided this reading of the seal acting suspicious and strange. 
		Readings show the seal was present at the time of recording and acting almost uncannily "seal-like". HARD EVIDENCE DOESN'T LIE.

		<h3>ARTIST'S RENDITION OF THEIR SEAL-RELATED VISION!!!</h3>
		<p id="dreamtesty">Talented but cash-strapped CFA students helped render this recreation of an Allston resident's drunken 
		vision of the Marsh Plaza seal being lifted by itself and revealing a powerful beam of light...Drunk daydream or apocolyptic vision???

		<h3>TESTIMONIAL FROM SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS THE SEAL HAUNTED THEM<h3>
		<p id="testy"> In an interview with a recent BU dropout who wished to remain anonymous, the bleak consequences of
		anyone who dares to make contact with the seal were revealed. This student accidentally made contact with the seal
		while evading a tour group on her way to class. Her dreams were soon haunted by visions of a Boston Terrier pissing on her dorm room carpet, and the subsequent 
		guilt caused a mental breakdown and a leave of absence from the university...A guilty conscious or something far more sinister???
